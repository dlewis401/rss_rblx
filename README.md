# Riverdale Secondary School - Website
This was a fun product I created back in December 2020 for a now disbanded ROBLOX roleplay group. 

This is mobile & tablet responsive and was my last website before a long break in Web Development due to GCSEs & A-Levels and life in general. 

It has a bit of JS - such as for switching images. Pretty basic.
